# Contributing to SYNTHIX

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SYNTHIX! This document provides guidelines and workflows for contributing to this experimental metaphysical operating system.

## Development Philosophy

SYNTHIX embraces these core principles:

1. **Modularity** - Components should be loosely coupled with clear interfaces
2. **Metaphysical Integrity** - Maintain consistency in how agents and universes interact
3. **Openness to Emergence** - Design for unexpected behaviors and properties
4. **Accessibility** - Make complex concepts approachable for various skill levels

## Code Structure

SYNTHIX is organized into several key directories:

```
synthix/
├── kernel/              # MetaKern kernel module
├── system/
│   ├── are/             # Agent Runtime Environment
│   ├── use/             # Universe Simulation Engine
│   └── shell/           # Command-line interface
├── gui/                 # Graphical user interface
├── agents/              # Agent models and architectures
├── universes/           # Universe templates and configurations
├── docs/                # Documentation
└── build/               # ISO building scripts
```

## Setting Up a Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/synthix.git
   cd synthix
   ```

2. **Set up a test environment**
   ```
   # Create a Python virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install development dependencies
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. **Run the tests**
   ```
   pytest
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a topic branch**
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Implement your changes**
   - Follow the coding style (see below)
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```
   pytest tests/your_component/
   ```

4. **Submit a pull request**
   - Provide a clear description of the changes
   - Link to any relevant issues
   - Include examples or screenshots if applicable

## Coding Style

We follow these general guidelines:

- **Python**: PEP 8 with 4-space indentation
- **C/C++**: Linux kernel style for MetaKern module
- **Shell Scripts**: Use shellcheck for validation
- **Documentation**: Markdown with clear examples

## Areas for Contribution

### MetaKern Kernel Module

- Optimizing agent process scheduling
- Improving memory management for agent beliefs
- Enhancing time dilation mechanisms
- Adding new metaphysical primitives

### Agent Runtime Environment (ARE)

- Developing new cognitive architectures
- Improving perception and action pipelines
- Creating tools for agent debugging and introspection
- Enhancing inter-agent communication mechanisms

### Universe Simulation Engine (USE)

- Implementing more sophisticated physics models
- Creating specialized universe templates
- Developing causality visualization tools
- Optimizing simulation performance

### User Interfaces

- Enhancing the command-line shell
- Improving the graphical interface
- Creating new visualization tools for universes
- Developing agent monitoring dashboards

### Documentation and Examples

- Writing tutorials and guides
- Documenting agent architectures
- Creating example universes
- Developing educational resources

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Unit Tests**: All components should have unit tests
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **System Tests**: Test end-to-end workflows
4. **Metaphysical Tests**: Verify emergent properties and behaviors

## Documentation Guidelines

Documentation should include:

1. **API Reference**: Clear documentation of interfaces and functions
2. **Conceptual Guides**: Explanation of core concepts and metaphysical principles
3. **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for common tasks
4. **Examples**: Sample code and configurations

## Metaphysical Considerations

When developing for SYNTHIX, consider these philosophical aspects:

1. **Agent Autonomy**: Respect the conceptual boundaries of agents
2. **Causal Consistency**: Maintain logical cause-effect relationships
3. **Subjective Experience**: Consider how agents might experience the system
4. **Emergent Phenomena**: Be open to unexpected systemic behaviors

## Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **Discussions**: Conceptual and design discussions
- **Wiki**: Collaborative documentation
- **Mailing List**: Technical announcements and discussions

## Code Review Process

Pull requests require:

1. At least one approving review from a maintainer
2. Passing all automated tests
3. Documentation updates (if applicable)
4. No unresolved discussions

## Release Cycle

SYNTHIX follows semantic versioning:

- **Major versions**: Significant architectural changes
- **Minor versions**: New features and enhancements
- **Patch versions**: Bug fixes and minor improvements

## Community Guidelines

We strive to maintain a welcoming and inclusive community:

- Be respectful and considerate in communications
- Provide constructive feedback
- Acknowledge the contributions of others
- Help newcomers get started
- Discuss ideas openly and thoughtfully
